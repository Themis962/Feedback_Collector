# Feedback_app
an extremely simple feedback app
To use the app you need to install XAMPP and place a folder with all the files in "C:\xampp\htdocs" (Windows default) then you need to run Apache from the XAMPP control panel and simply copy and paste the following url in your browser to run it http://localhost/Feedback_app/

The app uses HTML with JavaScript for functionality, css to make it more appealing and php to be able to process and store data into the feedback file
